📊 Data Analysis & Visualization Project – Titanic Survival Analysis
I recently completed an end-to-end data analysis project based on passenger data from the historic RMS Titanic disaster.

🔎 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze passenger data to identify the key factors that influenced survival rates. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, I explored patterns related to demographics, ticket class, fare, and other variables to uncover meaningful insights.

🛠️ What I Did
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
Removed irrelevant columns
Converted categorical data into usable formats
Checked for inconsistencies and duplicates

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed survival distribution
Examined survival rates by gender, age group, and passenger class
Explored correlations between fare, class, and survival
Identified patterns and outliers in the dataset
✔️ Data Visualization
Created bar charts, histograms, and count plots
Compared survival rates across different categories
Visualized relationships between socioeconomic status and survival

📈 Key Insights
🔹 Gender played a major role in survival probability
 🔹 First-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates
 🔹 Children had better survival chances compared to many adults
 🔹 Fare and passenger class were strongly associated with survival outcomes

💡 What I Learned
This project strengthened my ability to:
Work with real-world historical datasets
Perform structured exploratory data analysis
Extract meaningful insights from raw data
Communicate findings effectively through visualization
Apply analytical thinking to understand cause-and-effect relationships
Projects like this are helping me build a strong foundation in Data Science and Engineering, and I’m excited to continue applying data-driven approaches to real-world problems.
